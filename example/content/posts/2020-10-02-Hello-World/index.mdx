I started to build this personal website yesterday.

## $\LaTeX$ Support

LaTeX test:

$$x^3+y^3=z^3$$

Though I'm quite satisfied showing my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/sleepymalc), it turns out that I have much more want to show. For example, GitHub is extremely unfriendly to show `.pdf` files since the internal link (we call it *hyperlink* for those $\LaTeX$ geeks) doesn't work. This kind
of problem arises quite often. Besides, my only hobby these days is *photographing*, and as you may already know, no one will show their photos on GitHub!

Apart from all these, since I use $\LaTeX$ a **LOT** (yup, I'm one of those $\LaTeX$ Freaks), and the only way I know how to render $\LaTeX$ formula on GitHub is *ugly*, and it can only render fixed color texts, hence this makes me made my mind eventually.
For example, we can easily print out some beautiful formula like
{/* $$\begin{tikzcd}
			S & {G_\alpha} \\
			{G_\beta} & {G_\alpha \ast_S G_\beta} \\
			&& X
			\arrow["{i_{\alpha \beta} }", from=1-1, to=1-2]
			\arrow["{i_{\beta \alpha} }"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
			\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
			\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
			\arrow["{\exists !}", dashed, from=2-2, to=3-3]
			\arrow[curve={height=-12pt}, from=1-2, to=3-3]
			\arrow[curve={height=12pt}, from=2-1, to=3-3]
		\end{tikzcd}$$ */}

which is just a simple [commutative diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_diagram) for [Seifert–Van Kampen theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seifert%E2%80%93Van_Kampen_theorem), or like
$$ \frac{1}{m(B(x, r))}\int_{B(x, r)}\left\vert f(y) - f(x) \right\vert\,\mathrm{d}y = 0 \text{for a.e. \(x\)} $$
for $f\in L^1$, which is the statement of [Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_differentiation_theorem).
